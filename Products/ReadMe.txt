My program is selling video games. You have a list of options to choose from. 
Here is the list:
A....Add a new game to inventory
D....Delete a game from the inventory list
P....Displays the products
S....Save to a File
C....Clear all records
Q...Quit

A) is to add a game of your choice to the inventory. Its going to ask for the 
id of the game, the name, and the price of the game. Then its going to go back
to the main menu.
D) is to delete a game from the inventory. You need to know the id of the game
so i have a display of the id and the name of the game. Just enter the id of the 
game and the game deleted will be replaced by the last game.
P) is to display all the games in the inventory. It will show you the id, name
, and the price of each game.
S) is to save the whole inventory to a file for your records. It saves the id,
 name, and the price of each game.
C) clears all of the games on inventory. Everything on record will be wiped
clean.
